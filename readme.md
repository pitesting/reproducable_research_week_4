## Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 2

#Synopsis
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and

economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can

result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such

outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This project involves

exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA)

storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and

weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as

well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

#Goal
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and

answer some basic questions about severe weather events. Must use the

database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire

analysis. Analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries.

May use any R package you want to support your analysis.

#Questions

Data analysis must address the following questions:
1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the

EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
